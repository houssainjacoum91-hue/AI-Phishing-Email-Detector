## 🏗 Architecture

User Email Input  
        ↓  
Text Preprocessing (TF-IDF)  
        ↓  
Machine Learning Model (Logistic Regression)  
        ↓  
Prediction Output (Phishing / Legitimate)

## ⚙ How It Works

1. The user submits an email message.
2. The system converts the text into numerical features using TF-IDF.
3. The trained machine learning model analyzes the features.
4. The email is classified as phishing or legitimate.
5. The result is displayed to the user.
